Lab 1
==================

The goal for this lab is to get you introduced with ROS.

For this lab we are going to show you some slides and show some examples of how you can use ROS. If you wish to try some of the commands yourself you can download the simulator we will use: [stage](http://rtv.github.io/Stage/) simulator.

The following instructions have been tested under Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic.

1. How to install ros stage

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-stage-ros
    ```

2. Ensure that you are able to go into the package:

    ```bash
    roscd stage
    roscd stage_ros
    ```
